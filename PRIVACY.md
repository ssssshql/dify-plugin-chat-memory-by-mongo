# Privacy Policy for Chat Memory by MongoDB Plugin

---

## Data Collection  
This plugin does â€‹**not**â€‹ collect or store personal data directly. The plugin interacts with the MongoDB database configured by the user to store and retrieve conversation histories between users and AI. All data processed (e.g., chat messages, metadata) is stored exclusively in the user-provided MongoDB instance. The plugin has no access to or control over this data beyond the userâ€™s explicit configuration.

---

## Data Usage  
The data stored in the userâ€™s MongoDB database is used â€‹**solely**â€‹ to maintain conversation history for continuity in AI interactions. This enables features like context-aware responses and historical chat retrieval. No data is processed, analyzed, or used for purposes unrelated to the pluginâ€™s core functionality. Data retention and management depend entirely on the userâ€™s MongoDB configuration.

---

## Data Sharing  
This plugin does â€‹**not**â€‹ share any data with third parties. All conversation data resides in the MongoDB instance specified by the user. Users are responsible for ensuring their database complies with applicable privacy laws and security standards. For details on MongoDBâ€™s data practices, refer to the [MongoDB Privacy Policy](https://www.mongodb.com/legal/privacy-policy).

---

## Data Security  
While the plugin facilitates data storage, security depends on the userâ€™s MongoDB configuration. Users must implement appropriate safeguards (e.g., encryption, access controls) for their database. The plugin does not handle or manage security for the stored data.
